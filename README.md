# OIDC-example

This project demonstrates the implementation of an OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication system without relying on any
external libraries. The goal is to provide a deeper understanding of each step in the OIDC authentication flow.

Google is used as the authentication provider, following their
official [OpenID Connect guide](https://developers.google.com/identity/openid-connect/openid-connect).
